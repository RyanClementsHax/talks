# Tuning Android app performance for 150 MILLION devices

by Ryan Clements, Owner of Byte Bot

<!--
Thank you all for coming! Let me first tell you a story...

<!--
After a month or so of hard study and interview prep, I walked through the doors of Amazon in June of 2022. The team I joined was in the Fire TV department responsible for producing the News app. It was built using Android and before this job, the only experience I ever had in it was via side projects. That would quickly change.

<!--
The News app itself was stable and making a good chunk of change through advertisements. That being said.... there was something new being planned on the horizon and that‚Äôs what my team was going to ship.

# We wanted...

The same app, but genericized to other types of content like

<v-clicks>

<span><carbon-basketball class="opacity-60" /> Sports</span>

<span><carbon-video class="opacity-60" /> Trailers</span>

<span><carbon-apple class="opacity-60" /> Food</span>

<span><carbon-plane class="opacity-60" /> Travel</span>

<span>...</span>

</v-clicks>

<!--
We were pretty bullish with our plans. We wanted to take the business model of the News app, add enabled streaming, and genericize it for arbitrary genres, or channels as we called them.

Over the next 8 months (soon to turn 11 üò¨) we scaffolded, prototyped, and iterated like crazy. Around the turn of the new year of 2023, we had enough of a prototype that people could start playing around with...

# Beware of ContentProviders

ContentProviders run before other code during startup.

Look through your app's merged `AndroidManifest.xml` for lines like

```xml
<provider
    android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup"
    android:exported="false"
    tools:node="merge">
    <!-- This entry makes ExampleLoggerInitializer discoverable. -->
    <meta-data android:name="com.example.ExampleLoggerInitializer"
          android:value="androidx.startup" />
</provider>
```

---
layout: center
---

```java {all|17}
// http://tinyurl.com/5n78k6cp
public class InitializationProvider extends ContentProvider {
    @Override
    public final boolean onCreate() {
        Context context = getContext();
        if (context != null) {
            // Many Initializer's expect the `applicationContext` to be non-null. This
            // typically happens when `android:sharedUid` is used. In such cases, we postpone
            // initialization altogether, and rely on lazy init.
            // More context: b/196959015
            Context applicationContext = context.getApplicationContext();
            if (applicationContext != null) {
                // Pass the class context so the right metadata can be read.
                // This is especially important in the context of apps that want to use
                // InitializationProvider in multiple processes.

                AppInitializer.getInstance(context).discoverAndInitialize(getClass());
            } else {
                StartupLogger.w("Deferring initialization because `applicationContext` is null.");
            }
        } else {
            throw new StartupException("Context cannot be null");

1. Create a separate app per genre ‚ùå

2. Rewrite the existing app ‚ùå

3. Create a new app that had its UI configured from the backend ‚úÖ

...but it has to be Trojan horse'd into the News app's apk... üôÉ

<!--
Before we get into performance optimizations, let‚Äôs zoom into the architecture of the app. Because we wanted to have the app be as generic as possible and make changes to the UI without having to do another OTA, a very expensive, time consuming process, we implemented a pattern called server driven UI or SDUI.

This is a pattern where the server sends down a description of the UI tree to create, and the app dumbly renders it; thereby allowing UI changes to be a server redeployment, not an app redeployment. Fun fact! We aren‚Äôt the only ones doing this, Airbnb is another company doing the same thing. Have you used Amazon Luna? They use it too, so this isn‚Äôt a new solution.

The reason why I bring this up is because to make this pattern practical, you need to introduce a cache on the app so it doesn‚Äôt need to refetch the UI definition every time it starts up. The workflow looks like this.

Instead of 20 apps each for a different genre, we would have one app we could deliver content to and add content to it declaratively by tweaking backend configuration, as opposed to the OTA route we took for the News app.

# Behold! It's technically functional

<!--
Oh, and one more complication. We couldn‚Äôt create a new apk. We had to trojan horse the new app within the News app for a variety of reasons, the most important of which was it allowed us to deploy quicker and benefit from being preinstalled on devices.
